The task_terminal.c is the simulation of Bash Shell in C.

To run it on your system, make sure you have lreadline installed on your device.

compilation command: gcc task_terminal.c -lreadline -o as
run command: ./as

After this a simulated shell will get open on the terminal where this code is being executed.

Linux commands like: ls, cd, sort, mkdir, grep, cat are available for execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To exit the shell, type 'exit' on the shell. This will also terminate the program.
